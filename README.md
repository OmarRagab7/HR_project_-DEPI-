# 🚀 About the Project 
This project was developed as part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)** under the supervision of industry experts. It focuses on analyzing HR data using **Python (Jupyter Notebook), SQL Server, Excel, and Tableau**, along with other essential data analytics tools.  


# 📂 Dataset Overview  
The dataset consists of HR-related records, including:  
- Employee demographics and personal details.  
- Performance metrics and evaluations.  
- Salary distributions and job roles.  
- Attendance and turnover rates.  


# 🛠 Tools & Technologies  

This project leverages a combination of powerful tools and technologies for data processing, analysis, and visualization:  

🐍 **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Pandas and NumPy handle structured data, while Matplotlib and Seaborn create insightful visualizations for trend analysis.

🛢 **SQL Server** (Data Extraction & Querying)
Enables efficient data retrieval, transformation, and aggregation using complex SQL queries, joins, window functions, and stored procedures.

📊 **Excel** (Advanced Power Query & Pivot Tables)
Used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and summarization. Power Query automates data transformation, while Pivot Tables provide dynamic data analysis.

📉 **Tableau** (Interactive Dashboards & Visual Analytics)
Allows the creation of dynamic, visually compelling dashboards with filters, drill-downs, and real-time data updates for enhanced decision-making.

![HR Icon](images/hr_icon.png) 🦋 



## 🏆 About the Project  
This project was developed as part of the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)** under the supervision of industry experts. It focuses on analyzing HR data using **Python (Jupyter Notebook), SQL Server, Excel, and Tableau**, along with other essential data analytics tools.  


## 📂 Dataset Overview  
The dataset consists of HR-related records, including:  
- Employee demographics and personal details.  
- Performance metrics and evaluations.  
- Salary distributions and job roles.  
- Attendance and turnover rates.  


## 📌 Tools & Technologies  

- 🐍 **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
  Used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Pandas and NumPy handle structured data, while Matplotlib and Seaborn create insightful visualizations for trend analysis.  

- 🛢 **SQL Server** (Data Extraction & Querying)  
  Enables efficient data retrieval, transformation, and aggregation using complex SQL queries, joins, window functions, and stored procedures.  

- 📊 **Excel** (Advanced Power Query & Pivot Tables)  
  Used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and summarization. Power Query automates data transformation, while Pivot Tables provide dynamic data analysis.  

- 📉 **Tableau** (Interactive Dashboards & Visual Analytics)  
  Allows the creation of dynamic, visually compelling dashboards with filters, drill-downs, and real-time data updates for enhanced decision-making.  

## 📅 Project Timeline 
The project was completed over a span of **4 weeks**, with each week focusing on a different aspect of HR data analysis:  

| 📆 Weeks        | 📌 Activities  |
|----------------|--------------|
